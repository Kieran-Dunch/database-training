-- A new restaurant, Bytes of China, has just moved to a busy street in Chinatown
-- from a previous location. Bytes of China has hired you to design its database
-- schema so that it can display its menu on its new website, It has provided you
-- with a copy of its current menu.

-- We are writing a script to create a SQLite database for Bytes of China.

-- first, the restaurant and address tables
CREATE TABLE restaurant (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  -- restaurant belongs to address
  name varchar(20),
  description varchar(100),
  rating decimal,
  telephone char(10),
  hours varchar(100)
);

CREATE TABLE address (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  street_number varchar(10),
  street_name varchar(20),
  city varchar(20),
  state varchar(15),
  google_map_link varchar(50),
  postal_code integer
);

-- now write a query to verify that the primary keys exist
SELECT
  constraint_name, table_name, column_name
FROM
  information_schema.key_column_usage
WHERE
  table_name = 'restaurant' OR table_name = 'address';

-- now on to the menu and item tables
-- the menu contains certain categories of items
-- each category has a unique letter code, which is the primary key
CREATE TABLE category (
  id char(2) PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(20),
  description varchar(200)
);

-- validate the proper creation of the primary key
SELECT
  constraint_name, table_name, column_name
FROM
  information_schema.key_column_usage
WHERE
  table_name = 'category';

CREATE TABLE dish (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(50),
  price money,
  description varchar(200),
  hot_and_spicy boolean
);

SELECT
  constraint_name, table_name, column_name
FROM
  information_schema.key_column_usage
WHERE
  table_name = 'dish';
