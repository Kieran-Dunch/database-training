-- A primary key is a designation that applies to a column or multiple columns
-- of a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table. For example, a
-- Social Security Number for an employee may serve as a primary key in an
-- employee table with rows of employee data.

-- It is written as follows:
CREATE TABLE recipe (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  name varchar(20),
  ...
);

-- You can make anything a primary key technically, but they must be unique. Here are osme options:
CREATE TABLE book (
  title varchar(100),
  isbn varchar(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  pages integer,
  price money,
  description varchar(256),
  publisher varchar(100)
);

CREATE TABLE chapter (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  number integer,
  title varchar(50),
  content varchar(1024)
);

CREATE TABLE author (
  name varchar(50),
  bio varchar(100),
  email varchar(20) PRIMARY KEY
);

-- Key Validation
-- As part of an international SQL standard, the information schema is a
-- database containing meta information about objects in the database including
-- tables, columns and constraints. This schema provides users with read-only
-- views of many topics of interest.

-- You can use this to check if a column is a primary key:
SELECT
  table_name,
  column_name,
  constraint_name
FROM
  information_schema.key_column_usage
WHERE
  table_name = 'recipe'
  AND column_name = 'id';

--  It will return something like:
-- table_name | column_name | constraint_name
-- -----------+-------------+----------------
-- recipe     | id          | recipe_pkey
