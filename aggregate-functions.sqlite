-- SQL Queries donâ€™t just access raw data, they can also perform calculations
-- on the raw data to answer specific data questions.

-- Calculations performed on multiple rows of a table are called aggregates.



-- COUNT() counts the number of rows in the column
-- SUM() adds up all the values in the column
-- AVG() calculates the average of values in the column
-- MAX()/MIN() gets the maximum/minimum value of the column
-- ROUND() rounds the values in the column

-- COUNT()
-- COUNT() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument
-- and counts the number of non-NULL values in that column.

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM table_name;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM fake_apps
WHERE price == 0;

-- SUM()
-- SUM() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument
-- and returns the sum of all the values in that column.

SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name;


SELECT SUM(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

-- MAX() and MIN()
-- MAX() and MIN() are functions that return the highest and lowest values in a
-- column, respectively.

SELECT MAX(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

SELECT MIN(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

-- AVG()
-- AVG() is a function that takes the name of a column as an argument
-- and returns the average value of that column.

SELECT AVG(downloads)
FROM fake_apps;

SELECT AVG(price)
FROM fake_apps;

-- ROUND()
-- ROUND() is a function that takes a column name and an integer as arguments.
-- It rounds the values in the column to the number of decimal places specified
-- by the integer.

SELECT ROUND(price, 0)
FROM fake_apps;

-- Combining Aggregate Functions
SELECT ROUND(AVG(price), 2)
FROM fake_apps;
