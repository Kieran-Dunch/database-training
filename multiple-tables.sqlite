-- In order to efficiently store data, we often spread related information across multiple tables.

-- here are three separate tables:
SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM subscriptions
LIMIT 5;

SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 5;

-- The orders table has information about each order a customer has made.
-- The subscriptions table has information about which subscriptions a customer has.
-- The customers table has information about the customer.
-- if they were all combined into one table, there would be a lot of redundant information.
